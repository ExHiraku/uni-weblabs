                <p class="md-text">Development is (as of mid 2020-lockdown) a 2 year hobby of mine that I have been
                    progressively
                    improving in almost daily. Starting off with very basic python, moving up to more intermediate and
                    advanced aspects of the language through developing discord bots. I used to take enjoyment from
                    running communities on the platform, and having the ability to develop my own bots to do whatever I
                    need them to do in order to help manage said communities was a huge help. The image below showcases
                    a small snippet of what my development workspace looks like for discord bots, using Visual Studio
                    Code. I later progressed onto basic-level web development, and have much more recently begun Java to
                    begin exploring the minecraft-modding space.</p>

                    entrepreneurship. I still create content from time to time in the form of twitch streams, and have
                    recently begun short-form content for platforms such as YouTube and TikTok.</p>
